Automated Model Rail Roader (automrr) is a system to programmatically automate a model railroad using DCC (Digital Command Control) and COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) parts. It replaces closed-system components and the manual throttle network typically leveraged by model railroading enthusiasts.

## Goal
Upskill in the IoT domain by authoring and developing a complex embedded systems project that interests me.
